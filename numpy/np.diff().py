'''
NumPyâ€™s np.diff() function calculates the difference between subsequent values in a NumPy array. 
For example, np.diff([1, 2, 4]) returns the difference array [1 2].

By defining the argument n, you can execute the diff function multiple times on the respective output of the last execution. 
Hence, the call np.diff(x, n=2) results in the same output as np.diff(np.diff(x)).

# Fibonacci Sequence with first 8 numbers

print(diff_fibs) # -> [1 0 1 1 2 3 5 8]
