'''
Syntax:
dictionary.setdefault(keyname, value)

keyname	= Required. The keyname of the item you want to return the value from
value	= Optional. A value to return if the specified key does not exist. Default value = None

Sometimes, not only do you want to protect from an undefined term in your dictionary, but you also want your code to self-correct its data structures. 
The .setdefault() is structured identically to .get(). 
However, when the term is undefined, in addition to returning a default value, the dictionaryâ€™s term will be set to this value as well.

Where it differs from .get() is that the term and definition are now part of the dictionary

car = {

  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

x = car.setdefault("price", 15000)
y = car.setdefault("price")
z = car.setdefault("brand")

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

print(car.items())
