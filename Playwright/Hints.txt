pytest.ini
What it does:

--headed runs with visible browser (like headless=False)
--screenshot only-on-failure takes screenshots when tests fail
--video retain-on-failure records video of failing tests
--output saves results to a folder


Good! You already have a pytest.ini! Let's uncomment and merge the Playwright options properly:
ini[pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py *_test.py

# Combined options: pytest + Playwright
addopts = 
    -q
    -ra
    -s
    --headed
    --browser chromium
    --screenshot only-on-failure
    --video retain-on-failure
    --output ./test-results

markers =
    smoke: quick checks
    e2e: end-to-end ui
What changed:

Merged both adopts sections into one
Uncommented the Playwright options
Each option on its own line (cleaner)

What each option does:

-q = quiet mode (less verbose output)
-ra = show summary of all test results
-s = show print statements (don't capture stdout)
--headed = show browser window (not headless)
--browser chromium = use Chrome
--screenshot only-on-failure = screenshot failed tests
--video retain-on-failure = video of failed tests
--output ./test-results = save artifacts here


playwright codegen -> for recording new tests !!!!!!!!!
