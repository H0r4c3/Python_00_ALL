Playwright in Python — Roadmap
🎯 GOAL

Automate browser actions using Python: open sites, click buttons, fill forms, check results, take screenshots, etc.

🧩 Phase 1 — Core Basics (you are here)

Learn one concept per step:

✅ async_playwright() → start Playwright

✅ p.chromium.launch() → open browser

browser.new_page() → open a new tab

page.goto(url) → go to a website

page.title() + assert → verify page title

page.screenshot() → save screenshot

await browser.close() → clean exit

📘 After these: you’ll know how to automate basic browsing.

🧩 Phase 2 — Interacting with the Page

page.click() → click buttons, links

page.fill() → type text into forms

page.locator() → find elements by CSS, text, or role

page.wait_for_selector() → wait for something to appear

assert something → verify what happened

📘 After these: you’ll create real tests (e.g., login to a page, check messages, etc.).

🧩 Phase 3 — Using pytest (for real testing)

Organize tests in folders (tests/test_01_navigation.py)

Learn about pytest.mark.asyncio

Add setup/teardown (run before/after tests)

View test results, screenshots, and logs in VS Code

📘 After these: you can test a real website automatically.

🧩 Phase 4 — Advanced Topics (optional but fun)

Record a test and export it to Python

Handle popups, downloads, frames

Run tests in parallel

Integrate with CI/CD or GitHub Actions

🧭 What you’ll gain

After these lessons, you’ll be able to:

Build browser automation in Python

Write real tests that check your site automatically

Use VS Code + pytest to run and debug tests

Later: connect Playwright with Machine Learning or data pipelines
