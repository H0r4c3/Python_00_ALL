Perfect! Let's start integrating Playwright with pytest - this is what companies use!

First: Install pytest-playwright
In your terminal (with your venv activated):
bashpip install pytest-playwright
Then install the browsers for pytest:
bashplaywright install
```

## Pytest Basics - Example 71

Create a new folder structure:
```
Playwright/
├── tests/
│   └── test_basic.py

New concepts:

def test_ - pytest finds functions starting with test_
page - pytest-playwright automatically provides this (a fixture)
assert - checks if something is true, fails the test if false
No sync_playwright() or browser.launch() needed - pytest does it!
