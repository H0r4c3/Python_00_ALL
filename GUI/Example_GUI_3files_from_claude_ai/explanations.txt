Example of script in Python having 3 .py files: 1 file with printing 3 values in a method in a class, another file with GUI for this, having 3 input fields in a method in a class, where to enter the values, 1 file beeing the App who is using the both first files.


I'll help you create a multi-file Python script that demonstrates a simple application with class-based structure and GUI interaction. I'll break this down into three files to show how they interact.


Data Processor Class (data_processor.py)
Click to open code

GUI Input Class (data_gui.py)
Click to open code

Main Application (main.py)
Click to open code
Let me break down the structure and purpose of each file for you:

data_processor.py:
Contains the DataProcessor class
Responsible for storing and processing input values
Has methods to set and print the values
Demonstrates basic data handling logic
data_gui.py:
Contains the DataEntryGUI class using Tkinter
Creates a GUI with three input fields
Handles user input and validation
Uses a callback mechanism to submit data
main.py:
Contains the Application class that ties everything together
Creates instances of DataProcessor and DataEntryGUI
Provides a callback method to process input from the GUI
Serves as the main entry point of the application
To run the application:

Save each file in the same directory
Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed
Run main.py
The application flow works like this:

When you run main.py, a GUI window opens
You enter values in the three input fields
Clicking "Submit" validates the input
If valid, it calls the process_input method
The method stores values in DataProcessor
The values are printed to the console
This example demonstrates several important programming concepts:

Object-oriented programming with classes
Separation of concerns (GUI, data processing, main application)
Callback mechanisms
Basic GUI programming
Modular design
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the code or explain the design choices in more detail?
