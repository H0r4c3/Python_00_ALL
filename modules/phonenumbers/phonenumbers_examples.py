#number = input("Enter your phone number")

print(timezone.time_zones_for_number(service_provide))


# Program to convert input to phonenumber format

# Phone number format: (+Countrycode)xxxxxxxxxx
#phoneNumber = phonenumbers.parse("+919876543210")
phoneNumber = phonenumbers.parse("+40723450294")
  
# This will print the phone number and it's basic details.
print(phoneNumber)


# Program to get timezone a phone number

# Parsing String to Phone number
phoneNumber = phonenumbers.parse("+40723450294")
  
# Pass the parsed phone number in below function
timeZone = timezone.time_zones_for_number(phoneNumber)
  
# It print the timezone of a phonenumber
print(timeZone)



# Program to find carrier and region of a phone number

# Parsing String to Phone number
phoneNumber = phonenumbers.parse("+40723450294")
  
# Getting carrier of a phone number
Carrier = carrier.name_for_number(phoneNumber, 'en')
  
# Getting region information
Region = geocoder.description_for_number(phoneNumber, 'en')
  
# Printing the carrier and region of a phone number
print(Carrier)
