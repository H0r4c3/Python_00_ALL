'''
Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.
Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. Thereâ€™s no need to manually add 
query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. 
Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to urllib3.
