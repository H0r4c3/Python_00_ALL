00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,793
[Lady Whistledown]

Grosvenor Square, 1813.

2
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:41,172
Dearest reader,

the time has come to place our bets

3
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,749
for the upcoming social season.

4
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,838
Consider the household

of the Baron Featherington.

5
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,258
Three misses

foisted upon the marriage market

6
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,894
like sorrowful sows

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,311
by their tasteless…

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,219
Tighter.

9
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,977
…tactless mama.

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,349
-Tighter!

-Is she to breathe, Mama?

11
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,106
I was able to squeeze my waist

into the size of an orange and a half

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,519
when I was Prudence's age.

13
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,147
Your sister shall do the same.

14
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,904
[gasps]

15
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,645
[Lady Whistledown]

Far better odds might exist

16
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,698
in the household

of the widowed Viscountess Bridgerton.

17
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,868
A shockingly prolific family,

18
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,084
noted for its bounty

of perfectly handsome sons

19
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,586
and perfectly beautiful daughters.

20
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,588
[groans] I am already roasting.

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,380
Are you to complain

the entire day, Eloise?

22
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,384
Surely I cannot be expected

to bear these fashions the entire day.

23
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,677
I feel like a princess.

Do I look like one?

24
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,891
Do you truly wish to know

what I think you look like?

25
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,811
-On your left!

-Oh, Gregory!

26
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,310
Is our dear sister still not ready?

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,391
She's only been readying herself

the entire night.

28
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,727
You mean her entire life.

29
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,902
I shall run upstairs and hasten her along.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,900
-Colin, wait. I'll do it.

-She likes me better than you, Benedict.

31
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,493
-Did she say that?

-Everyone says that.

32
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,778
[Eloise groans]

33
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,739
Daphne!

34
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,372
You must make haste!

35
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,368
Should you think she heard me?

36
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,171
[Lady Whistledown]

How very perfect, indeed!

37
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,472
[Hyacinth] Stop it.

38
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,510
[sighs]

39
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,808
[Gregory] If you don't hurry up,

we're going to be late.

40
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,072
[indistinct chatter]

41
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,236
[indistinct chatter continues]

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,200
Any sign of him yet?

43
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,249
[sighs]

44
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,917
Should your brother wish

to be obeyed as Lord Bridgerton,

45
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,633
he must act as Lord Bridgerton.

46
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,303
Where is he, Benedict?

47
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,471
I do not know.

48
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,759
Hmm.

49
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,092
[both moaning, grunting]

50
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,019
[grunting, moaning continues]

51
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,574
-Anthony! You are here.

-Of course I am here, Sister.

52
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,945
I'd never miss such an important day

for you and our family.

53
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,662
No, you would just be late for it.

54
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,122
[exhales]

55
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,253
Shall we?

56
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,130
[indistinct murmuring, whispering]

57
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,548
[Lady Whistledown]

Today is a most important day,

58
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,143
and for some a terrifying one,

59
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,679
for today is the day

60
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,642
London's marriage-minded misses

are presented

61
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,694
to Her Majesty the Queen.

62
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,399
May God have mercy on their souls.

63
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,069
Miss Prudence Featherington,

64
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,118
Miss Philipa Featherington,

65
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,408
and Miss Penelope Featherington…

66
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:52,247
all presented by their mother,

the Right Honorable Lady Featherington.

67
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,212
[attendees exclaiming, gasping]

68
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,767
[attendees chattering indistinctly]

69
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,446
[Lady Whistledown] It is only

the queen's eye that matters today.

70
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,409
A glimmer of displeasure…

71
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,246
[attendees gasp]

72
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:37,382
…and a young lady's value plummets

to unthinkable depths.

73
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,842
[indistinct murmuring]

74
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,301
Miss Daphne Bridgerton,

75
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,222
presented by her mother,

76
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,232
the Right Honorable,

the Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton.

77
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,207
Flawless, my dear.

78
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,060
-[whispering] Did that truly just happen?

-[quietly] Keep smiling, dearest.

79
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,352
They are watching you…

80
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,597
now more than ever.

81
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,277
[Lady Whistledown] But as we know,

the brighter a lady shines,

82
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,699
the faster she may burn.

83
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,598
[Lady Whistledown] It has been said that,

84
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,181
"Of all bitches dead or alive,

85
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,187
a scribbling woman is the most canine."

86
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,150
[women gasp]

87
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,940
If that should be true,

88
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,783
then this author would like

to show you her teeth.

89
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,899
[laughs]

90
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,570
My name is Lady Whistledown.

91
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,617
You do not know me,

and rest assured, you never shall.

92
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,583
But be forewarned, dear reader,

93
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,674
I certainly know you.

94
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,086
-You absolutely sparkled, Sister.

-[both giggle]

95
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,553
Come, now. I merely simpered and minced

in a pretty dress like everyone else.

96
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,135
Not exactly like everyone else.

97
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,060
Oh, I shall need to go

and visit with Penelope.

98
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,098
Her presentation was anything but…

What was it the queen called you again?

99
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,233
Flawless…

100
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,976
or some such thing.

101
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,311
Trust I was astonished

Her Majesty offered me,

102
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,067
out of 200 young ladies present,

a most gracious remark.

103
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,780
Yes, it was quite a distinction.

104
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,030
And now 200 young ladies

have a common adversary.

105
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,244
-I wish you luck, Sister.

-[Francesca] Eloise!

106
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,414
What? It is true.

107
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,952
My success on the marriage mart

influences all of your prospects.

108
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,997
We will all need to find love one day.

109
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,133
Indeed, a love as pure

as what Mama and Papa once shared,

110
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,590
if we are so fortunate.

111
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,879
I merely hope I am able

to continue such a grand tradition.

112
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,216
Your dresses have arrived.

113
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,301
[girls] Oh!

114
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,885
[girls giggling]

115
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,101
[Daphne] Oh!

116
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,060
This one is quite ravishing.

117
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,521
Mary Edgecombe wore

a similar shade last season.

118
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,562
And secured three offers

the very next day, one from an earl.

119
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,976
Mary Edgecombe,

now the Countess of Fulton,

120
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,275
apparently spent the last year

living in a cottage

121
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,109
hundreds of miles away from her earl.

122
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,824
She is miserable. It says it all here.

123
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,325
Do not tell me that is

yet another scandal sheet. Eloise--

124
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,248
No, no, this one is different.

This one lists subjects by name, in full.

125
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,789
-[gasps] Let me see!

-Wait. Wait!

126
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,504
-"Lady Whistledown."

-"Lady Whistledown"?

127
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,796
-[Eloise] The author.

-[Violet] Do we know a Lady Whistledown?

128
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,010
Surely Lady Whistledown

cannot be her true name.

129
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,224
What does it say, dearest?

130
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,351
She loathes the fact that we've been named

alphabetically, oldest to youngest.

131
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,889
-Your father and I found it orderly.

-Lady Whistledown finds "banality."

132
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,524
The papers were distributed

across town today without charge.

133
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,102
Without charge? What kind of author--

134
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,477
[both gasp]

135
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,903
[both chuckle]

136
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,322
Well, at least she has one thing right.

137
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,110
She has named Daphne

as the season's Incomparable.

138
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,405
She calls you

a "diamond of the first water."

139
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,949
Well, how lovely!

140
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,123
[chuckles]

141
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,623
[Lady Featherington]

I should not be surprised

142
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:06,253
if this Whistledown is revealed

to be Violet Bridgerton herself.

143
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,132
These pages certainly report

on the viscountess's family

144
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,210
with much indulgence, indeed.

145
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,165
The pages report nothing

but the truth, Lady Featherington.

146
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,466
Daphne has bloomed exquisitely,

147
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,929
and the sooner

she is taken from the market,

148
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,970
the better for the other young ladies…

149
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,385
even ones prone to hysterics

in front of the queen.

150
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,597
Ladies, hurry with your miniatures

before our guest arrives.

151
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,818
And, Penelope, put down that book at once.

152
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,818
You shall confuse your thoughts.

153
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,070
[Lady Cowper] So…

154
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,395
tell me about this cousin.

155
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,317
Joining you for the entire season?

156
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,276
She is a distant cousin of my husband,

157
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,407
and with no close female relative

to sponsor her debut,

158
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:49,375
Lord Featherington has directed me

to take her in for charity.

159
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,668
Hmm. You are known to be quite charitable.

160
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,303
Precisely what this new rumormonger

should have published,

161
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,341
instead of erroneously specifying

162
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,085
that I shall only have three young ladies

under my care this year.

163
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,007
She knows nothing.

164
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,635
Unless you shall like to have

only three young ladies under your care.

165
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,765
I should gladly sit this season out.

166
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,232
Penelope is quite nervous.

This shall be her very first season.

167
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,863
I am not nervous, Mama.

168
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,860
What she is is two stone heavier

than she ought to be.

169
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,863
Mm, those blemishes on her face

are quite difficult to conceal.

170
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,066
Perhaps some arsenic and lead might help.

171
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,737
Should you allow me to delay only a year,

172
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,115
just as Lady Bridgerton

has done for Eloise,

173
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,332
I may remain dedicated

to my studies, perhaps.

174
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,463
The answer is no, Penelope.

175
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,495
You may wish to listen to her, my lady.

176
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,495
Shepherding four young ladies

177
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,467
through these endless rounds of affairs

at the same time…

178
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,468
[scoffs] Can you imagine the competition?

179
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,549
Well, how much competition

can this cousin provoke?

180
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,847
She came of age on a farm,

she has a mere four-figure dowry,

181
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,272
and as for her appearance…

182
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,600
Well, let us hope Miss Thompson

is more presentable

183
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,567
than the legions of unkempt animals

she has spent her entire life

184
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,148
-tending to back home. [laughs]

-Mm.

185
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,197
Lord Featherington's cousin

has arrived, madam.

186
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,869
[gasps] Now, remember to be kind, ladies…

187
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,736
and charitable.

188
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,407
The poor are our burden.

189
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,576
[clears throat]

190
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,627
Oh!

191
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,261
She's beautiful.

192
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,297
Good afternoon, Lady Featherington.

193
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,604
[exhales deeply]

194
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,955
Well, if this is not a sight

for my sore eyes!

195
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,009
My condolences,

Your Grace, for your father.

196
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,259
-Very kind of you.

-Kind of me?

197
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,511
You hated the man.

198
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,304
It is so wonderful

to see you, Lady Danbury.

199
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,597
Words I do not hear often enough.

200
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,521
Come.

201
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,188
You must excuse the, uh, disorderliness.

202
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,610
As you know,

I'm to host a ball this evening.

203
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,519
Yes.

204
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,896
I have managed to keep

the details of your return quiet.

205
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,105
But when those vulgar mamas discover

206
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,115
that there is an eligible duke

present at tonight's fete,

207
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,909
I shall be able to keep such a secret

no longer.

208
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,995
That is what I was hoping to discuss.

209
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,710
I have only returned to London

to deal with my late father's affairs.

210
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,541
I'm afraid

it leaves me no time to… socialize.

211
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,377
And so, whilst I appreciate

your most gracious invitation,

212
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,513
Lady Danbury,

I must ask you to accept my regrets.

213
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,547
Your regrets…

214
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,345
are denied.

215
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,390
-I suppose a brief appearance--

-Excellent.

216
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,725
You may leave

that flask you carry at home.

217
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,982
Most undignified.

218
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,279
[woman singing operatic scales]

219
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,714
[singing continues]

220
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,502
[both moaning, grunting]

221
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,168
Someone may hear us, my lord.

222
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,376
[Anthony] Mm.

223
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,640
[moaning, grunting continues]

224
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:43,112
One day, I shall seize that watch

and take it apart bit by bit.

225
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,782
That belonged to my father.

226
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,203
Should it disappear,

I would miss it sadly.

227
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,700
Then you shall know

precisely how I feel…

228
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,992
every time you disappear.

229
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,615
Stay with me today.

230
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,581
I'm afraid I cannot.

231
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,248
-[groans]

-Mm.

232
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,296
I must chaperone my sister

at the Danbury ball this evening.

233
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,717
-Daphne, yes?

-Mm.

234
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,431
What might they be like,

235
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,311
these grand affairs

your sister must attend?

236
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,269
You… would hate them.

237
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,809
-[chuckles]

-Every eligible lady of breeding

238
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,903
dressed in some lavishly trimmed frock,

239
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,647
bloodthirsty mamas at their sides…

240
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,572
[Siena chuckles]

241
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,740
…and wary fathers making arrangements

242
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,989
for only the most advantageous of matches.

243
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:33,161
And of course, without my father here,

that responsibility… falls upon me.

244
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,992
A significant duty, no doubt.

245
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,997
Someone must guard my poor sister

from the bucks and pinks,

246
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,039
ensure her virtue remains free

of any kind of defilement.

247
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,455
Daphne is fortunate.

248
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,343
Every woman is not afforded

such gallant protection.

249
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,091
Every woman is not a lady.

250
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,051
Of course not, my lord.

251
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,180
Siena.

252
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,641
Hey.

253
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,135
You have me…

254
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,520
protecting you too.

255
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,937
I will always protect you.

256
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,566
[Siena moans lightly]

257
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,158
[Lady Whistledown]

The season's opening ball at Danbury House

258
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:21,044
is a most highly

sought-after invitation, indeed,

259
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,463
for every darling debutante

260
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:28,552
from Park Lane to Regent Street

will be on display.

261
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,473
[rendition of "Thank U, Next"

by Vitamin String Quartet playing]

262
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,385
[Lady Whistledown]

Titled, chaste, and innocent,

263
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,936
this is what they have been raised

and trained for since birth.

264
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,110
Tonight, we shall discover

265
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,862
which young ladies might succeed

at securing a match,

266
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:57,615
thereby avoiding the dreadful,

dismal condition known as "the spinster."

267
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,241
Oh, I do love to dance.

268
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,078
Do you like my flower?

We grow them in our very own garden.

269
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,674
I must show you my watercolors sometime,

if you desire to see them.

270
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,501
And she is quite proficient

on the pianoforte too.

271
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,811
[Lady Cowper]

Is that not the young lady

272
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,556
who was caught

with her gentleman last year

273
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,778
in Lady Mottram's conservatory,

unchaperoned?

274
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,029
She's lucky her gentleman agreed

to a hasty marriage

275
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,112
after she went and ruined herself.

276
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,157
Lightskirts.

277
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,371
[soft chuckle]

278
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,428
[indistinct conversation]

279
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,976
They're all staring, Mother.

280
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,481
Allow them to come to you, dearest.

281
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,486
Oh!

282
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,696
Look who's already setting his cap

at Miss Bridgerton.

283
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,488
Lady Bridgerton, Miss Bridgerton.

284
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,156
Lord Bridgerton.

285
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,995
I believe you have already been introduced

to my daughter Daphne, Lord Ambrose.

286
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,172
Uh, yes. We met at your brother's levee.

287
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,251
If I recall, my lord, you had just won

your first race at Newmarket.

288
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,007
His first and only, I believe.

289
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,585
Well, in that case,

290
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,465
let us hope his lordship

has found himself a new horse.

291
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,393
[chuckles]

292
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,520
I haven't had the pleasure of seeing you

at our club lately, Ambrose.

293
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,599
Should it have anything to do

with the unpaid balance

294
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,354
you left on our betting books winter last?

295
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,862
Ambrose is a cheat.

296
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,065
A man of any honor

ensures his debts are fully paid.

297
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,866
I did not realize…

298
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,158
Well, how could you have done?

It is the very reason I am here, Sister.

299
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,621
Let us take a turn about the room.

300
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,133
[chuckles softly]

301
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,635
He is rather pleasing.

302
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,429
He is rather here

to shuffle about hunting fortunes.

303
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,734
Trust Mr. Lewis knows

of your sizable dowry.

304
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,808
Leave him be.

305
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,225
-I presume you know of him too?

-Mr. Worthington. Second son.

306
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,193
We shall find better.

307
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,032
He is of dubious parentage.

308
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,237
I shall not have you making a life

with a poet, heaven forbid.

309
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,412
Nor an eccentric.

310
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,950
My word!

311
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,991
Anthony! Daph!

312
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,788
If the only gentlemen present this evening

are your brothers,

313
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,672
then we're in a great deal of trouble,

indeed.

314
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,459
You continue to say "we."

315
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,962
Did Mother tell you yet? About my tour?

I'm to begin in Greece.

316
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,916
-Greece? How adventurous, Colin!

-On guard!

317
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,047
[clears throat nervously]

318
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,723
Too late.

319
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,222
I already noted you.

320
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,723
-Lady Danbury.

-Good evening.

321
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,095
Miss Bridgerton,

you look rather lovely this evening.

322
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,104
Is there a reason

I've yet to see you on the dance floor?

323
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,226
All in good time, Lady Danbury.

324
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,067
You poor thing.

325
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,786
Who is that?

326
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,365
I'm sure I've never seen her.

327
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,877
Miss Marina Thompson,

a distant cousin of my husband's.

328
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
She's rather dowdy, is she not?

329
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,125
One of the Bridgerton boys

is joining the swarm.

330
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,849
Well!

331
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,430
[Lady Cowper] Most telling!

332
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:53,016
I imagine your household will be

a hive of callers in the morning…

333
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,403
Lady Featherington.

334
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,725
Where one suitor goes,

the rest will surely follow.

335
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,943
[Lady Cowper chuckles ironically]

336
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,660
Excuse me.

337
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,367
[indistinct conversation]

338
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,417
[quietly] There.

339
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,180
The duke. I would recognize him anywhere.

340
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,604
-Mama, where are you taking us?

-To meet the duke.

341
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,845
That man is not in our miniatures.

342
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,220
Make haste

before he should see Miss Thompson.

343
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,348
Your Grace.

344
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,902
[girls giggling, chattering]

345
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,478
Let me introduce my daughters,

Miss Prudence Featherington,

346
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,944
Miss Philipa Featherington.

347
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,028
[girls chattering excitedly]

348
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,871
I'm quite parched.

349
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,999
I shall fetch you

a glass of lemonade.

350
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,843
No. You have already done

so much for me tonight.

351
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,709
I shall return in a mere moment.

352
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,889
Good evening.

353
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,400
Small glasses.

354
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,239
-Lord Berbrooke.

-Tiny little things, are they not?

355
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,374
The glasses? I suppose.

356
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,490
Then the matter is settled.

357
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,036
I'm not entirely sure the matter

in which we discuss, my lord.

358
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,041
You've always amused me, Miss Bridgerton,

359
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,424
ever since I was a schoolboy,

and you were…

360
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,165
All but… five?

361
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,134
[chuckles]

362
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,054
[slurps loudly]

363
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,260
[exhales]

364
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,798
My brother, he summons me.

365
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,466
-Ah. [chuckles]

-Adieu.

366
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,064
Miss Bridgerton?

367
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,021
A moment, please! [chuckles]

368
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,614
Miss Bridgerton?

369
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,902
[Daphne] Oh!

370
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,488
-[gasps] Pardon me.

-Forgive me.

371
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,195
Ah, yes. Wait just one second, thank you.

372
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,698
Tell me your name.

373
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,200
Your name, sir?

374
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,578
Am I honestly to believe

you do not already know my name?

375
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,248
[low] One moment. Yes, yes. Oh, hello.

376
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,045
[laughs boisterously]

377
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,759
If you desired an introduction, madam,

378
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,259
I do believe accosting me

to be the least civilized of ways.

379
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,261
Accosting you?

380
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,642
Truly, they will try anything.

381
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,349
Sir, that is not…

382
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,600
This is not…

383
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,182
-What is your name?

-[Anthony] Basset.

384
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,227
Basset!

385
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,150
-Bridgerton!

-Come here, old friend!

386
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,268
I heard news of your father.

387
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,148
-Deuce take it, you are no longer Basset.

-I shall--

388
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,863
Hastings! The Duke of Hastings,

now known for evermore.

389
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,321
The Duke of Hastings, is it?

390
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,831
-Right, Hastings, this is my sister.

-Your sister?

391
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,042
Daphne, Hastings and I know each other

from our days at Oxford,

392
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,253
days we shall not soon forget.

393
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,923
Yes. As I am well aware

of the company you keep, brother,

394
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:11,175
I am certain your days with His Grace

were most civilized, indeed.

395
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,264
Hastings, we shall need

to get together properly.

396
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,808
-I expect to see you at our club, then.

-Indeed.

397
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,062
Evening, Bridgerton.

398
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,057
Miss Bridgerton.

399
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,411
Daphne, I believe

Lord Wetherby is looking for you to dance.

400
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,576
-Is he?

-If only it weren't time for us to retire.

401
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,075
Daphne's anything but weary.

I shall stay with her.

402
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,087
-That would be lovely.

-Daphne…

403
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,509
there is nary a gentleman here

who would not take your hand.

404
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,088
You must think about this.

405
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,594
The most perfect thing to do now

is not to dance,

406
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,507
but to leave them all wanting more.

407
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,717
If anyone knows how this works,

408
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,556
it is your eldest brother.

409
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,394
Perhaps he is right.

410
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Let us go.

411
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,648
[scoffs softly]

412
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,247
[door opens]

413
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,709
Miss! You've already awakened!

414
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,842
Have Cook prepare

as many biscuits as he can this morning.

415
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,588
Perhaps we might move a few extra chairs

into the drawing room too.

416
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:35,092
I do wonder which gentleman

will be the very first to call.

417
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,011
I have so much to ask of them all.

418
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,756
Well, let us get you dressed.

419
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,096
[Daphne sighs]

420
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,895
Anthony!

421
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,028
I did not expect

to see you here this morning.

422
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,115
It is terribly early for you, dearest.

423
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,410
I could not sleep for some reason.

All the excitement, I presume.

424
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,121
Am I the first gentleman to arrive?

425
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,544
How wonderful!

426
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,046
[rendition of "Girls Like You"

by Vitamin String Quartet playing]

427
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,132
[sighs]

428
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,886
Callers, ma'am. The Earl of Stafford

and the Marquess of Finley.

429
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,814
My word! Well, you should have

my colorful fashions to thank.

430
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,314
[clears throat]

For a Miss Marina Thompson.

431
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,278
[Lady Whistledown]

Dearest reader, this author finds herself

432
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:40,083
compelled to share

the most curious of news.

433
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,368
And do you have

a large family, too, my lord?

434
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:46,712
It seems our diamond

requires a closer inspection.

435
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,920
Is there a problem, Lord Bridgerton?

436
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,337
I should think so. You are in my seat.

437
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,970
As such, an even rarer jewel

438
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:05,933
of only the most remarkable brilliance,

fire, and luster has been unearthed.

439
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,897
Her name, unknown to most,

yet soon known to all,

440
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,939
is Miss Marina Thompson.

441
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,817
Should you not be out

on your daily walk about the square, dear?

442
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,565
It appears as though it may rain.

443
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,278
[clears throat]

444
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:29,829
This author is left to wonder

whether Her Majesty might reconsider

445
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,036
the high praise

she once afforded Miss Bridgerton…

446
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,760
for we all must know what

the queen despises more than anything…

447
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,010
Being wrong.

448
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,849
And the drawing room at Bridgerton House

currently appears to be emptier

449
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,854
than the muddled head

of her dearest King George.

450
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,395
Well, I must be off to my club, then.

451
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,197
Sisters. Mother.

452
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:09,367
It follows that Lady Featherington

is to receive what she has always desired:

453
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,786
the season's true Incomparable

living under her own roof.

454
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,957
She must be overjoyed.

455
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,916
Is Miss Thompson so high in her instep

456
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,258
that she's unable to don her own slippers?

457
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,893
I should think not.

458
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,477
Has anyone else read

what Lady Whistledown has written of late?

459
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,401
Should anyone pay any heed

to what Lady Whistledown writes of late?

460
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,611
I certainly do not.

461
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,197
Mama, perhaps we might attend

the upcoming Salisbury ball by ourselves

462
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,778
and the Merriweather tea too.

463
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:46,413
I believe that Anthony has already replied

on our behalf, dearest.

464
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,662
Apparently, he has managed

our social calendar through June.

465
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,746
He'll be there for the entire season?

466
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,881
Lady Whistledown has made her opinion

of our dear sister's fortunes quite clear.

467
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,049
Oh, enough about Lady Whistledown!

468
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,337
A caller for Miss Bridgerton.

469
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,925
Oh! [chuckles]

470
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,138
The Lord Berbrooke.

471
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,272
Lord Berbrooke.

472
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,652
Um… Uh… Come in!

473
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,861
May I help you

to some freshly prepared biscuits?

474
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,863
[chuckles nervously]

475
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,204
Eloise, allow some room

for his lordship, will you?

476
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,990
[Violet chuckles]

477
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,163
Eloise, are you not due

for a visit with Penelope this morning?

478
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,793
-I believe I should like to stay.

-I believe you should like to go.

479
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,210
[Eloise groans lightly]

480
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,330
[clears throat]

481
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,508
[Eloise chuckles]

482
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,683
Forgive me for not calling sooner.

483
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,733
I presumed

your affections were already engaged.

484
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,608
Now I know.

485
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,605
You and I were destined for each other.

486
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,942
[scoffing chuckle]

487
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,491
[Lord Berbrooke crunching loudly]

488
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,783
[inhales shakily]

489
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,408
And so, by Heaven, your love may burn

490
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,326
from the depths of my soul.

491
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,634
'Tis thee I shall earn.

492
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:27,303
Wonderful, wonderful.

Gentlemen, thank you for your calls.

493
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:32,135
Do not forget to bid Prudence, Philipa,

or even Penelope farewell as you go.

494
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,980
[suitors chatter indistinctly]

495
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,189
-A most wretched sonnet, indeed.

-Lord Byron he is not.

496
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,480
[chuckles]

497
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,323
I do not believe so. Good day, Pen.

498
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,824
Lord Berbrooke is harmless.

There will be others.

499
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,580
Lady Whistledown has all

but declared me ineligible…

500
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,249
worthy of the affection

of a detestable simpleton

501
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,252
and no one else.

502
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,543
Tell me, what others should ever want

such damaged goods now?

503
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,248
[Anthony]

You speak as if Lady Whistledown

504
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,088
were to be held in higher regard

than Her Majesty the Queen herself.

505
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,218
You give far too much credit

to some anonymous scribbler.

506
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,262
These musings, they're not true.

507
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,466
Only they are true, Brother,

and they are true because of you.

508
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,307
You have managed

to scare every worthy suitor away.

509
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,103
Whistledown has merely reported it.

510
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,437
I am looking out for you.

I am protecting you.

511
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,902
-It is my duty.

-And what of my duty?

512
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,820
You have no idea what it is to be a woman…

513
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,778
what it might feel like

514
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,577
to have one's entire life

reduced to a single moment.

515
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,117
This is all I have been raised for.

516
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,463
This… is all I am.

517
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,831
I have no other value.

518
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,379
If I am unable to find a husband,

I shall be worthless.

519
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,383
Daphne, you're a Bridgerton.

520
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,585
[scoffs] It would be easier if I were not.

521
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,427
[clicks tongue]

522
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,717
Go on.

523
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,562
[Lady Whistledown]

Ambitious mamas rejoice,

524
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:08,567
for the new Duke of Hastings continues

to grace our fair city with his presence.

525
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,623
And, oh,

what an impressive presence it is!

526
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,536
Lady Whistledown has written

about you again, Your Grace.

527
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,370
Would you like to read it?

528
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,615
It should be noted

529
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:24,747
that the duke has been overheard

announcing to mamas everywhere

530
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,416
that he has no plans of ever marrying.

531
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,129
This author wonders

532
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,795
which brazen matchmaker

shall rise to such a challenge,

533
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,135
for this competition is well underway.

534
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,688
You know, I do suppose if it were not

for an overzealous mother at every corner,

535
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,148
this time of year in the city

would not be so very dreadful.

536
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,609
Those mothers simply want

the same as you, I rather think.

537
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,320
For every last one of them

to choke on their daughters' hair ribbons?

538
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,191
For you to claim a wife, Hastings.

539
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,873
Are you not planning on taking your place

in society when you have a dukedom?

540
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,578
I have a title, which, as far

as I'm concerned, will end with me.

541
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,869
-But Hastings--

-Stop calling me that.

542
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,754
It was my father's name. Never mine.

543
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,581
And in any case, what of you?

544
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,133
What of me?

545
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,760
You are the firstborn Bridgerton

of a firstborn Bridgerton,

546
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,718
nine times over. Where is your wife?

547
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,087
[waiter] Right away, sir.

548
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:18,472
Oh! Is your plan to fuck her forever,

your mistress?

549
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,389
You shall need to sire an heir.

550
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,936
I'm in possession

of something that you are not.

551
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,977
Brothers.

552
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,574
[Lady Whistledown]

It has reached my ears

553
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:33,529
that Mr. Colin Bridgerton

shall be awarded the year's grand prize

554
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:37,533
when he sweeps Miss Thompson

off her pretty little slippered feet.

555
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,527
[Marina laughs]

556
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,698
You could always send the willow

back to that farm, madam.

557
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,332
As if Lord Featherington

would ever allow that.

558
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,456
[Marina laughs]

559
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,958
[both chuckling]

560
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,625
[Lady Whistledown] In other news,

561
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:59,347
a most peculiar suitor

for Miss Daphne Bridgerton has emerged.

562
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,430
Daphne…

563
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,234
[clears throat] Your caller.

564
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,355
Will it be just the two of us…

565
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:08,935
yet again?

566
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,655
[classical ensemble playing]

567
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,969
-Our box, Mama?

-Mm-hmm.

568
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,013
Lady Bridgerton!

569
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,313
Do join us.

570
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,984
Your Majesty, good evening.

571
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,975
You must remember my daughter, Daphne.

572
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,027
Yes.

573
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,404
She made quite an impression…

574
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,368
however fleeting it may have been.

[snorting chuckle]

575
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:06,075
I would like to welcome you both

to my box this evening.

576
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,214
I insist.

577
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,042
[overture playing]

578
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,142
They are saying her husband will not live

till the end of the month.

579
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,848
Surely another rumor provided

by that vicious, scandal-mongering writer.

580
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,430
Should her degradation know no bounds?

581
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:30,436
[operatic singing]

582
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,821
Lady Whistledown writes

about my family too.

583
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,899
Yet I suppose the duke

can withstand such scrutiny,

584
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,605
since he is, after all, a man.

585
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,485
His Grace was fortunate

to have you there with him as a child

586
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,953
after what happened to his mother. Awful!

587
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,584
-He is not what Whistledown writes.

-Nor is Daphne.

588
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,082
It would seem the two of them

have that much in common, then.

589
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,745
Matches have certainly been made

with far less.

590
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,214
What are you suggesting?

591
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,588
Lady Whistledown

merely writes what she sees.

592
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,755
Perhaps we need to help her

to see things a bit more clearly.

593
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,726
The duke is quite fond of gooseberry pie.

594
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,151
The very dish my cook is renowned for.

595
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,953
[both chuckling]

596
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,791
[yells]

597
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:36,094
[panting heavily]

598
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,094
[women giggling]

599
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,255
[Benedict] Haven't you heard

what we're talking about?

600
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,434
For all we know,

Whistledown may be some interloper

601
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,143
living in Bloomsbury, of all places.

602
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,983
What should be

so terrible about Bloomsbury?

603
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,938
That people there

actually work for a living?

604
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,558
She does seem to be someone with access.

605
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,055
-Who knows if Whistledown is even a she?

-[Anthony] Fair point.

606
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,317
Because she is simply too good

to be anyone but a man?

607
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,280
Well, I think it rather obvious

that the writer is Lady Danbury.

608
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,071
Lady Danbury enjoys

sharing her insults with society directly.

609
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,195
She would never bother herself

writing them all down.

610
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,163
Could it be Lady Featherington?

611
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,123
-No!

-[all laughing]

612
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,413
[Anthony] No.

613
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,156
You have yet to read

what Whistledown writes

614
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,748
of the Featheringtons, little sister.

615
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,590
You must forgive

this rather unruly debate, Your Grace.

616
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,960
-Nonsense. I find it entertaining.

-Oh! [chuckles]

617
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,257
All of you at one table,

even the children.

618
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:28,642
Well, I realize it may be unfashionable,

but we like each other. [chuckles]

619
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,183
Most of the time.

620
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,266
You should join us more often,

Your Grace.

621
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,401
Perhaps when we travel

to our country seat.

622
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,898
You would be most welcome.

623
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,519
[Hyacinth] Gregory!

Would you stop tossing peas at me?

624
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,437
Those peas were already there.

You cannot tell me what to do. I am older.

625
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,947
-And I'm taller.

-Children… [chuckles]

626
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,777
He does have a presence about him.

627
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,374
If rakish dukes were one's thing.

628
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,174
-I'm to spar with Jackson himself.

-You?

629
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,579
[Colin] Is that envy I detect

in your voice?

630
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,417
[Benedict] Judgment, brother.

I shall need to witness this.

631
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,093
You appear displeased.

632
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,053
Do I?

633
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,092
We find ourselves seated

beside each other, Miss Bridgerton.

634
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,757
I'd like to think

you're happy about that.

635
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,765
Perhaps, Your Grace, it would be better

636
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,178
if you refrained

from thinking about me at all.

637
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,021
It is simply surprising.

638
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,983
Yes! However is it possible for a lady

to offer anything other than a smile

639
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,226
whilst seated beside a duke?

640
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,067
…you regarding subjects much too…

641
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,782
-Even one of your reputation.

-You are aware of my reputation.

642
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,583
I am aware of your friendship

with my eldest brother.

643
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,448
If that were not enough, I am also aware

644
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,495
of the things a certain writer

has recently written of you.

645
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
Presumptuous? Clearly.

646
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,245
Arrogant? Most definitely.

647
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,344
You are a rake… through and through.

648
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,590
Tell me I'm wrong.

649
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,971
Who is to refrain

from thinking about whom again?

650
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,889
[chuckles] I assure you.

I am anything but interested in you.

651
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,048
-Good.

-Quite.

652
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:53,216
And I anything but interested in you,

the eldest sister of my oldest friend,

653
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,267
yet another recent subject

of a certain writer.

654
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,811
Chaste, neat, desperate.

655
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,518
-I shall have you know--

-To marry, that is.

656
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,897
Tell me I am wrong.

657
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,443
[laughs]

658
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,067
[Eloise clears throat]

659
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,031
Hastings, I'm so glad

you decided to join us this evening.

660
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,117
-It was most spontaneous of you.

-Not at all.

661
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,292
With Lady Danbury accepting

your dear mother's gracious invitation

662
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,212
on my behalf…

663
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,250
Well, however could I have declined?

664
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,794
[Violet] You must stay for dessert.

665
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,877
It's gooseberry pie, Your Grace.

666
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,343
Ah! Lovely!

667
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,474
[chuckles]

668
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,063
You were a reasonable mother

until your eldest daughter came of age.

669
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,938
-Anthony…

-This matchmaking scheme

670
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:47,534
you rather transparently concocted

with Lady Danbury, it will not work.

671
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,276
I can think of worse matches

for Daphne than a duke.

672
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,445
-I believe the two of you to be friends.

-We are good friends.

673
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,496
Which is why I know he has

absolutely no intention of marrying.

674
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,461
You must understand

all men make that assertion.

675
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,791
-Your… Your father--

-Do not bring Father into this.

676
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,172
Even if he were in want of a wife,

677
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,757
you would most certainly not have

the duke anywhere near Daphne.

678
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,223
I am fully subscribed to the belief

679
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,353
that reformed rakes make

the very best of husbands.

680
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,510
He will not make her happy!

681
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,137
Daphne deserves better.

682
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,441
And I know… I know you think

you are solving the problem,

683
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,350
but you are not.

684
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,148
And that is all I shall say

about the matter.

685
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,371
The duke will be joining us

as our guest at Vauxhall tomorrow evening.

686
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,329
I admit, it was not easy

to convince him to come.

687
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,989
-You overstep.

-She is my eldest daughter.

688
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,497
-Yet she is my responsibility, as are you.

-Responsibility?

689
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,750
Do not make this

any more difficult than it already is.

690
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,462
I wish to know something, Anthony.

691
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,752
Tonight, when you leave this study

692
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,296
that you continue to keep

at your family home,

693
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,970
are you to return

to bachelor lodgings across the square,

694
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,180
or will you pay a visit

to a certain soprano that you tend to

695
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,471
in an apartment that you pay for

on the other side of town?

696
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,806
Relying on your younger brothers

to one day do the job that you cannot.

697
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,898
You like to speak of responsibility.

698
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,520
My dear son!

699
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,146
Of duty?

700
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,441
Pray tell, what should you know of it?

701
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,368
I sit with her in that drawing room.

702
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,818
Do you know what I see?

703
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,912
A young woman who is terrified

704
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,754
because she knows what kind of life,

what kind of future, awaits her

705
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,961
should you continue to get in her way.

706
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,292
[Anthony scoffs]

707
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,007
If your father was still here,

Daphne would already have been matched.

708
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,339
The man would have made an arrangement

with an old friend.

709
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,804
The man would have done

what was now necessary.

710
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,755
So you must ask yourself

711
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,135
are you merely an older brother,

712
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,890
or are you the man of this house?

713
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,995
I cannot see you anymore.

714
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,593
I… I do not understand.

715
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,762
It is not for you to understand.

716
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,015
I must do what is necessary.

717
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,058
You said you would always protect me.

718
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,483
You promised to care for me, my lord.

719
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,153
And now…

720
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,775
What shall I do now?

721
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,947
You shall leave.

722
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,953
[Lady Whistledown] Be it shame or slander,

723
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,157
seduction or smear,

724
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,707
there is but one thing

725
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,840
that humbles even the most highly-regarded

members of our dear ton…

726
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,880
a scandal!

727
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:00,973
Well, dear reader, it should seem

that all of Grosvenor Square

728
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,475
has been left to ponder

a rather scandalous question, indeed.

729
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:11,694
Might one former diamond's

recent fall from grace

730
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,284
turn out to be

the most damning scandal of all?

731
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,041
[lively orchestra playing]

732
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:30,922
Pen.

733
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,041
Colin.

734
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,337
-I did not know you would be here.

-Sorry to disappoint.

735
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,553
-[chuckles]

-Have you seen Miss Thompson?

736
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,100
She is ill.

737
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,138
My mama had to stay home with her.

738
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,812
Papa had to chaperone.

739
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,019
I'm quite enjoying

the fact that he is here.

740
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,692
Mama would never allow me

to wear a dress like this.

741
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,861
Not, uh, yellow enough, I think.

[chuckles]

742
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,941
Mr. Bridgerton.

743
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,146
I believe you owe me a dance this evening.

744
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,487
And I have only one more space

remaining on my card at present.

745
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,283
How convenient. [gasps]

746
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,117
-Penelope, I did not see you there.

-[Penelope gasping]

747
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,827
I'm afraid I cannot offer you

that dance, Miss Cowper.

748
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,536
I am to escort Miss Featherington

to the floor.

749
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,587
[fiddle music playing]

750
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,225
[guests laughing, cheering]

751
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,243
[indistinct conversation]

752
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,860
The resemblance is remarkable.

753
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,655
You look just like him.

754
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,819
Your father.

755
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,123
[MC] Ladies and gentlemen,

756
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,200
a most extraordinary event

is about to take place.

757
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,208
Right this way!

758
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,584
Come! Come!

759
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,097
[humming softly]

760
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,519
[gasps nervously]

761
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:27,081
-Madam.

-Yes… Varley?

762
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,121
[clears throat]

763
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,706
[MC] It is with great privilege

764
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,840
I present Vauxhall's

newest spectacle of illumination.

765
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,669
Feast your eyes above

766
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:44,378
and allow all that is radiant

to overwhelm you!

767
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,888
[guests gasping]

768
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,762
[guests exclaiming loudly]

769
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,178
[MC] Wonderful light!

770
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,426
Thank you!

771
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,978
[guests chattering excitedly]

772
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,784
Is it not the most bizarre?

773
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,490
[gasps] Look, Brother.

774
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,320
What is it?

775
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,406
Lord Berbrooke's barony

is over 200 years old.

776
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,492
His lineage is legitimate.

777
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,997
He has had an excellent education,

possesses no debts,

778
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,670
never hurt an animal or a woman,

and is even a decent shot.

779
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,802
To speak strictly,

there is nothing wrong with him.

780
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,632
-What should any of this--

-You are to marry him.

781
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,258
-Nigel?

-I had to find you a husband, Sister.

782
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,894
Now, be grateful it is done.

783
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,982
It should be just as easy

to fall in love with Lord Berbrooke

784
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,638
as with anyone else.

785
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,346
I will not hear of this.

786
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,106
[sighs]

787
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,750
You haven't bled.

788
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,509
It's been over a month since your arrival,

789
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,586
and you haven't bled.

790
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,891
[sighs]

791
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,139
I suppose I should be happy.

792
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,393
Up until now,

793
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,394
I've had no legitimate excuse

to dispense with you.

794
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,687
But when Lord Featherington hears of this,

795
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,816
when your own papa hears of this…

796
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,150
-Please…

-I suppose I should be happy.

797
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:30,235
And if it were guaranteed

that my own ladies would not be affected

798
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,124
by your revolting recklessness,

799
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,291
I would be!

800
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,789
Do you even know who the father is?

801
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,251
What I know is

that you shall never understand.

802
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,042
-What was that?

-You shall never understand!

803
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,210
Someone like you,

living this ridiculously charmed…

804
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,127
Did you think I wanted to come here…

805
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,644
to be around people like you,

806
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,469
so out of touch, so superior?

807
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,564
Ah!

808
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,686
[breathing shakily]

809
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,030
Whatever are you doing?

810
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,069
Nigel, not now.

811
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:11,986
"Nigel?"

812
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,534
Are we to drop the honorific so soon?

813
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,199
I suppose as your husband--

814
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,247
You will never be my husband.

I will never marry you.

815
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,706
My brother, he…

816
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,753
He made a mistake.

817
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,586
Do you think yourself better than me?

818
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,085
[Daphne] It'd be best for you to leave.

819
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,635
You should be thanking me.

820
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,848
I'm your last hope.

No one wants you, Miss Bridgerton.

821
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,720
-[Daphne] What are you doing?

-You'll find out.

822
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,977
[Daphne] Stop it!

823
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:38,978
Let go of me!

824
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,442
[grunts]

825
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,270
[Berbrooke moans]

826
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,686
[Daphne gasping]

827
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,324
Your Grace… I had no intention--

828
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,362
Of knocking the climp flat out?

829
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,775
[gasps]

830
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,454
Well, I must say, I am impressed.

831
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,283
What are you doing out here?

832
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,248
Avoiding certain people.

833
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,208
-People?

-Mothers.

834
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,958
They are people, I suppose.

835
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:06,092
You are coming from the Dark Walk.

It is merely a few steps away.

836
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,259
-What would you know of the Dark--

-The Dark Walk is merely a few steps away,

837
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,835
and I am alone with two men.

838
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,715
You are only with one man. The other is--

839
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,142
I'll be compromised just the same.

840
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,640
Do you have any idea what would happen

if someone even suggested that I--

841
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,064
I must go.

842
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,522
Marry me, Miss Bridgerton.

843
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,897
Now, as far as proposals go,

that may be the least romantic of all.

844
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,571
I suppose if someone were to find me here,

845
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,900
it would be one way out of marrying him.

846
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,816
You cannot possibly be thinking

of marrying him.

847
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:36,624
If I am unable to secure another offer,

there may be no alternative.

848
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,290
Unlike you, I cannot simply declare

I do not wish to marry.

849
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,964
I do not have such a privilege.

850
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,170
Yes, I was surprised to learn

851
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,879
you no longer have a line of suitors

around every square in London.

852
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,090
I am in no need of your derision, sir.

853
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,721
I do not mock you. I am being sincere.

854
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,046
I know

of what this Lady Whistledown has written.

855
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,216
Trust I possess as much contempt

for the author as you do.

856
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,806
She's all but issued a challenge

to London's most ambitious mamas,

857
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,982
encouraging, provoking them to--

858
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,981
Claim you as their prize?

859
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,693
Do not worry, Your Grace.

860
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,686
I believe such a win

861
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,605
would be promptly forfeited, indeed.

862
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,453
I must go this way.

You, through those trees.

863
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,782
Perhaps there is an answer…

864
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,826
to our collective Lady Whistledown issue.

865
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,208
[fireworks popping loudly]

866
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,666
[dramatic music plays]

867
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,773
We could pretend to form an attachment.

868
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,731
[dramatic music intensifies]

869
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,107
[Simon] With you on my arm,

870
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,403
the world will believe

I've finally found my duchess.

871
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,275
Every presumptuous mother

in town will leave me alone,

872
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,407
and every suitor will be looking at you.

873
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,459
You must know

men are always interested in a woman

874
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,882
when they believe another,

particularly a duke,

875
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,002
to be interested as well.

876
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,877
You presume Lady Whistledown--

877
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,844
I presume she'll deem us

to be what we are.

878
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,554
[Simon] Me, unavailable.

879
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,184
You…

880
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,181
desirable.

881
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,489
Stare into my eyes.

882
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,328
Here.

883
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,497
Closer.

884
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:58,342
If this is to work,

we must appear madly in love.

885
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,795
-It is an absurd plan.

-I find it quite brilliant.

886
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,136
Provided you do not wish to marry me,

887
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,101
and I do not wish to marry you,

888
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,062
whatever should you have to lose?

889
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,325
[dramatic music escalates]

890
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,138
[Lady Whistledown]

For those not in attendance

891
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,976
at the Vauxhall celebration,

892
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:55,021
you missed

the most remarkable coup of the season.

893
00:53:55,607 --> 00:54:00,067
It appears Miss Daphne Bridgerton

has captured the interest

894
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,243
of the newly returned Duke of Hastings.

895
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,951
How the young miss secured

her newfound suitor

896
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,367
is yet to be determined.

897
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,745
Yet, if anyone shall reveal

the circumstances of this match,

898
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,166
it is I.

899
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,965
Yours truly…

900
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,547
Lady Whistledown.

901
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:27,064
