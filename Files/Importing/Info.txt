Problem:
Importing: I need to learn, again, the best method for using imports from another folder. 
We have a folder A, in this folder there is a folder B and a folder C. 
In A there is a script a, in B there is a script b, and in C the script c. 
How can I import a and b in script c? Thank you.

A/
├── a.py
├── B/
│   └── b.py
└── C/
    └── c.py



Solution:
Step 1: Make A a proper Python package: Add __init__.py in each folder.
These files tell Python “this is a package” — without them, relative imports won’t work right.

A/
├── __init__.py
├── a.py
├── B/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── b.py
└── C/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── c.py



Best Method: Use Relative Imports

From c.py, you can import using relative imports.

Key points:

.. means "go up one level (to parent directory)"
..a means "parent directory, file a"
..B.b means "parent directory, folder B, file b"

Use relative imports with __init__.py files—it's the most Pythonic and maintainable approach!
