To solve the crossword, we can follow these steps:

Parse the input to obtain the crossword as a 2D list.
Find the word positions by iterating over the crossword and checking the rules for the beginning of words.
Generate a list of candidate words for each position by filtering the predefined word list based on the length and matching letters.
Fill in the crossword by trying out all possible combinations of candidate words.
Return the filled crossword as a sequence of strings.
Here's the Python code to implement the above algorithm:
'''

from typing import List
from itertools import product

def solve_crossword(crossword: List[str], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    # Parse the crossword
    n, m = len(crossword), len(crossword[0])
    crossword = [list(row) for row in crossword]

    # Find the word positions
    word_positions = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if crossword[i][j] == '.':
                if j == 0 or crossword[i][j-1] == 'X':
                    word_positions.append((i, j, 'across'))
                elif i == 0 or crossword[i-1][j] == 'X':
                    word_positions.append((i, j, 'down'))

    # Generate candidate words for each position
    candidates = {}
    for i, j, direction in word_positions:
        if direction == 'across':
            length = 1
            while j+length < m and crossword[i][j+length] == '.':
                length += 1
            pattern = ''.join(crossword[i][j:j+length])
        else:
            length = 1
            while i+length < n and crossword[i+length][j] == '.':
                length += 1
            pattern = ''.join(crossword[k][j] for k in range(i, i+length))
        candidates[(i, j, direction)] = [word for word in words if len(word) == length and all(word[k] == pattern[k] or pattern[k] == '.' for k in range(length))]

    # Fill in the crossword
    def backtrack(pos):
        if pos == len(word_positions):
            return True
        i, j, direction = word_positions[pos]
        for word in candidates[(i, j, direction)]:
            if all(word[k] == crossword[i][j+k] or crossword[i][j+k] == '.' for k in range(len(word))):
                # Fill in the word
                for k in range(len(word)):
                    crossword[i][j+k] = word[k]
                # Recursively backtrack
                if backtrack(pos+1):
                    return True
                # Undo the fill
                for k in range(len(word)):
                    crossword[i][j+k] = '.'
        return False

    if backtrack(0):
        # Return the filled crossword
        return [''.join(row) for row in crossword]
    else:
        return []
    
    
    '''
    To use the above code, you can call the solve_crossword function with the crossword and 
    the list of words, and it will return the filled crossword as a list of strings. 
    If there is no valid solution, it will return an empty list.
