00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,906
<i>Welcome to Iron Lake.</i>


4
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:26,484
<i>Population:</i>

5
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:29,268
<i>2,760.</i>

6
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,812
<i>On the surface,
Iron Lake may seem</i>

7
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:34,605
<i>like the idyllic snow globe town</i>

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,827
<i>Norman Rockwell
would jerk off to.</i>

9
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:40,879
<i>But I came here
because an overprivileged,</i>

10
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:43,120
<i>cis, white boy
named Matt Caldwell</i>

11
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,214
<i>went hunting
in the woods one day</i>

12
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:47,220
<i>and never came back.</i>

13
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:51,192
<i>So, of course,
everyone lost their goddamn minds.</i>

14
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:54,026
<i>Especially Matt's father,</i>

15
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,518
<i>local legend Kurt Caldwell,</i>

16
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:00,745
<i>who claims his son
is still alive.</i>

17
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:02,464
<i>But if that's true,</i>

18
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:04,370
<i>where is he?</i>

19
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,042
<i>What unfolded next,
murder fiends,</i>

20
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,183
<i>was more than
any true crime podcaster</i>

21
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:13,737
<i>could ever dream of.</i>

22
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:17,558
<i>Dark secrets lurk
beneath Iron Lake,</i>

23
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:20,671
<i>and the more I do the deep dive,</i>

24
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:22,745
<i>the more I come up with.</i>

25
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:25,847
<i>At this rate,
I may never have to leave.</i>

26
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,751
<i>You're listening
to Merry Fucking Kill.</i>

27
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:30,760
<i>And now, a word...</i>

28
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:34,519
This is Chief Angela Bishop,
Iron Lake P.D.

29
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,104
I need you to put out
an APB on someone

30
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:37,987
who's been missing for 72 hours.

31
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:40,551
<i>All right, what's
the name of the missing person?</i>

32
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,002
Molly Park.

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,275
Now I remember
why I picked this place.

34
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:53,970
So many good people.

35
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:57,458
Fred Jr, Pastor Brian.

36
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:02,213
Logan.

37
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:04,994
Teddy, Abraham.

38
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,705
Good folks.

39
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:12,087
All these people
working together to help me,

40
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:14,204
Mr. Serial Killer.

41
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,517
Make that
Mr. Serial Killer and son.

42
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:23,108
This fire is a sign.

43
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,954
If I'm going to teach
Harrison the Code,

44
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,494
it can't be here.

45
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,431
We need to talk.

46
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:31,553
Uh, sure thing.
You want to grab, uh,

47
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:33,353
- a coffee?
- No, we need to talk now.

48
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:34,797
Ah.

49
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:36,835
I just spoke to Gig.

50
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,554
There's strong evidence
that your fire was arson.

51
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:45,896
Arson?
Are you sure?

52
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,610
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.

53
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:50,135
'Cause Gig's been warning me
about that fire pit for...

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,814
Someone drenched your roof
with an accelerant,

55
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:53,408
most likely gasoline,

56
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:55,563
which makes this a crime scene.

57
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:57,742
Oh.

58
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:00,305
Why would someone do that?

59
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:04,375
Can you think of anyone
you crossed recently?

60
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,593
No one comes to mind.

61
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:13,328
It was probably those
Moose Creek douchebags.

62
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,798
Uh, a few of 'em tried
to jump me at the-at the

63
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:18,649
truck stop two nights ago.

64
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,084
- You were attacked?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,835
Did you get any names?

66
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,172
Uh, they were-they were friends
with that kid, Jeremy.

67
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:28,758
Uh, Zach or Scott
probably know who they are.

68
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,917
He truly is his father's son.

69
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:33,941
<i>...I'm gonna need
physical descriptions.</i>

70
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:35,612
- Yo, Jimbo!
- <i>And any other</i>

71
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:36,987
<i>details you can remember.</i>

72
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,711
Anything here you want to keep?

73
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:45,729
Hey, thanks, Teddy.
This was my father's.

74
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,291
Jim!

75
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:55,686
Keep your phone on.

76
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,580
I'm gonna stay
and poke around a little more.

77
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:01,131
Heard about the fire.

78
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,388
Uh, took up a collection
to help out.

79
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,087
Aw, you shouldn't have.

80
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:08,635
You really shouldn't have.

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,474
We, uh, we wanted to get you
a little something special.

82
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:17,004
Thought you might
be able to use a new jacket.

83
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:18,403
Coach...

84
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,865
Hey, it's from all of us.

85
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:23,925
Yeah!

86
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:27,817
<i>Speaking Spanish...</i>

87
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,674
Gracias.

88
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,604
Para todo.

89
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,674
You guys are too nice
in this town.

90
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:38,077
Hey, it's your town, too.

91
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,105
<i>There was a time
I would've given anything</i>

92
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,253
<i>to see him like this.</i>

93
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:42,916
Aw, shit, he's gonna cry.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,776
Happy. Embraced by friends.

95
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:47,127
Almost normal.

96
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:49,892
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on.

97
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:52,471
Let's pack up the-the boxes
and put them in Jim's truck.

98
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,823
No, it's all good.
Harrison and I got it.

99
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,737
Thanks again.

100
00:04:58,347 --> 00:04:59,848
You're too kind, really.

101
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:01,705
Takes a village.

102
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:19,783
So...

103
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:22,277
after last night,
we should probably figure out

104
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:23,674
where we want to live.

105
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,369
That makes sense.

106
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:27,749
Can't stay
at Angela's place forever.

107
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:30,212
Maybe somewhere warmer?

108
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:32,548
You mean away from Iron Lake?

109
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,823
That's what I'm thinking, yeah.

110
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,104
But-but I just got here.

111
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:39,768
I mean, I-I-I finally
feel like I fit in.

112
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:41,260
And you've done a great job,

113
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,682
but think about how good
a fresh start will feel.

114
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:47,307
What about Los Angeles?

115
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:50,268
It's kind of like Miami,
but without all that humidity.

116
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:54,658
It's 3,000 miles away
from my friends.

117
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:58,253
From Audrey.

118
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:01,994
I know it's hard,
but we can't be ourselves here.

119
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,277
We can't do what we do.

120
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:07,424
Come on.

121
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,338
So...

122
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,721
how does...

123
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:23,724
"what we do" work, exactly?

124
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,435
I mean, d-do we...

125
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:28,346
we see someone getting away
with murder, and...

126
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:31,096
uh, take care of them?

127
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,619
Something like that.

128
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,690
We'll research, make a list.

129
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:38,990
It's not hard to do
when you're in a big city.

130
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:41,527
And then, when our
Dark Passenger rises up,

131
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:42,868
we'll be ready.

132
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,565
Rises up?

133
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,207
Like during
your wrestling match,

134
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,959
when you broke that kid's arm.

135
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,619
Except, instead of hurting
someone innocent,

136
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,268
we bring justice
to someone who deserves it.

137
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:58,999
And save a lot
of innocent people.

138
00:07:00,902 --> 00:07:02,580
Yeah.

139
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,073
Can we get a pool?

140
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,807
Yeah, we can definitely
get a pool.

141
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:16,894
So, uh, when are you
gonna tell Angela?

142
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,705
'Cause I-I need to tell Audrey.

143
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,830
I'll let you know
when the time is right.

144
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,667
Hey, could you follow up

145
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,502
on a few Moose Creek kids?

146
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:35,518
Harrison said they...

147
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:38,963
Harrison said they...?

148
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:45,514
Ange? Everything okay?

149
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:56,165
<i>All right.</i>

150
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,308
No.

151
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:03,464
- <i>Thank you.
- Hey, you got a little...</i>

152
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:08,627
<i>Dogs... you know.</i>

153
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,455
Hey, you.

154
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,088
I hope pasta's okay.

155
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:22,643
It seemed, I don't know, cozy.

156
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:25,731
Can't-can't go wrong with pasta,

157
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,830
but you got to do it right.

158
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,674
Would you guys mind
going to Gig's

159
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,107
for some crushed red pepper
and parmesan?

160
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:34,705
Yeah. You got it.
Come on.

161
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:38,846
Oh, and, uh,
caramel fudge ice cream?

162
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:41,533
Yeah, get two.
We all deserve it.

163
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:46,414
All right.

164
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:49,750
Is my cabin still burned down?

165
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,127
Very.

166
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:54,987
Any clues, culprit-wise?

167
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,041
Yeah, I guess not.

168
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:00,213
Well, have some wine.

169
00:09:00,512 --> 00:09:02,221
Sorry to say,
it's a little bit...

170
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:04,349
smoky.

171
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:08,158
You okay?

172
00:09:10,813 --> 00:09:13,149
Hey. Don't worry about me.

173
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,088
I am the phoenix.

174
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,533
I rise from the ashes.

175
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,276
Hey, tell me what's going on...

176
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:25,453
Turn around!
On your knees!

177
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:27,126
Hands on your head.

178
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:29,362
Wh... You're taking the whole
role-playing thing

179
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:30,615
to the next level.

180
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:33,048
Shut the fuck up
and do what I say.

181
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:36,540
Okay.

182
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:42,938
<i>What could she possibly know?</i>

183
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:56,893
What the hell is this about?

184
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,399
<i>'Cause there's at least
a few options.</i>

185
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,500
Dexter Morgan,
you're under arrest

186
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:17,004
for the murder
of Matthew Stearn Caldwell.

187
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:20,244
Matt Caldwell's dead?

188
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,948
Get him the fuck
out of my house.

189
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:22,885
You have the right

190
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,275
to remain silent.
Anything you say...

191
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,787
Yes, okay, your chief already
told me to shut the fuck up.

00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:05,128
Take a seat, Harrison.
I'll talk to you in a bit.

229
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:08,524
Just grab a seat,
guys.

230
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:22,420
Do I need a lawyer?
'Cause...

231
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:23,882
Up to you.

232
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,550
For the record,
please state your name.

233
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:34,913
Jim Lindsay.

234
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,405
State your goddamn name.

235
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,663
Dexter. Dexter Morgan.

236
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:46,330
Hello, Dexter Morgan.

237
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,982
Hello, Chief Bishop.

238
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,647
Where were you the day
Matt Caldwell went missing?

239
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:53,608
I was...
at my cabin, alone.

240
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:55,374
Okay.

241
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,937
We've determined
that this person

242
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:01,669
- is Matt Caldwell.
- Yeah.

243
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:03,253
You remember when I came in

244
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,132
and identified that
distinctive rifle for you?

245
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,531
Yes. You're a good citizen.

246
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:07,882
I try to be.

247
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:09,801
Do you really have
no sense of sarcasm?

248
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:11,874
- No.
- Yes.

249
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:17,217
I... We never identified

250
00:13:17,427 --> 00:13:19,725
the second person
out in the woods that morning.

251
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,398
What's interesting is

252
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,577
he has the same build as you,

253
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:27,331
the same rifle
you own.

254
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,022
He even does that same
chin scratch thing you do.

255
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:34,664
Well, my body size is average,

256
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,411
- which means...
- I know what that means.

257
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,757
And dozens of people in
Iron Lake have that same rifle.

258
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:42,041
Hell, I personally sold
most of them.

259
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:44,972
And I don't really know
what you mean about...

260
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,257
...the chin scratch thing.

261
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,967
You know that Matt Caldwell
shattered his femur

262
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,559
in that boating accident
in Ohio?

263
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:00,991
I'd heard that.
What about it?

264
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:02,889
These are

265
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:06,257
the type of screws and plate

266
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,695
used to repair
that sort of fracture.

267
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,335
Okay, and?

268
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:16,514
And I found them in my mailbox,

269
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:18,913
along with...

270
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:21,319
this note.

271
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:29,952
Come on, Ange,
you're better than this.

272
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,233
I found this...

273
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,225
in the ashes of your cabin.

274
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,937
Remember when I said these
are the type of screws and plate

275
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,874
used on surgeries like Matt?

276
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,514
I was being oblique.

277
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,905
They're not just the type.

278
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:50,985
These are the actual screws

279
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,389
and plate used on Matt.

280
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,659
They've got serial numbers, so

281
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,702
I called
the Cleveland Clinic and...

282
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:00,952
And that's why we're here.

283
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,839
And your working theory is...

284
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:09,796
You went for
your morning walk...

285
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,256
No, I was home all day,
except for work and...

286
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,801
...where you saw Matt
kill the white deer.

287
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:16,491
You two argued.

288
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:18,874
Not hard to do, considering
Matt was always an asshole.

289
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:21,934
Maybe he attacked you.
Maybe it was self-defense.

290
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:24,435
Or maybe you're jumping to
conclusions that aren't there.

291
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,585
And then Harrison
shows up out of nowhere...

292
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:30,436
...and you had to get rid
of Matt's body.

293
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,027
And what's your theory
on that one?

294
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:35,085
You burned it.

295
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:37,616
Smart.

296
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:40,514
Until it isn't.

297
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,204
'Cause here's the hitch.

298
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,416
Titanium...

299
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,334
...doesn't melt.

300
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:53,128
A fact I've become
painfully aware of.

301
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:55,299
I also have a theory.
You want to hear it,

302
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:57,842
or are you just gonna tell me
to shut the fuck up?

303
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,725
Kurt lied

304
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:07,021
about Matt being in New York.

305
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:10,639
And then he lied about Matt
being at that cabin of his.

306
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:14,862
And then Kurt stripped that
same cabin down to the studs

307
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:17,280
a day after your friend,
Molly and I were there.

308
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:20,742
So, it's not outside the realm
of good, logical theory

309
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:23,536
that Kurt killed Matt
for any number of

310
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,789
accidental
or intentional reasons.

311
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:28,983
You yourself said,
"Matt was always an asshole."

312
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:31,913
Then he needed someone to frame.

313
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,734
Why not the boyfriend
of the chief of police

314
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,883
who just arrested
and humiliated him?

315
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,147
Hell, Kurt probably
burned down my cabin

316
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:45,054
just so you'd find
that damn screw.

317
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,452
Don't you see?
He set me up.

318
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:49,585
Ange...

319
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:52,936
he's trying to get back at you.

320
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:58,374
Look, you've been under
a ton of pressure lately.

321
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:00,342
And...

322
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:04,359
you just found
your best friend's body after so long.

323
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:06,287
You haven't even had a chance
to grieve for...

324
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:08,007
Don't you say her name!

325
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:11,319
Hey, hey.

326
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:15,553
Why don't we just give Jim...

327
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,124
Dexter... some time
to gather his thoughts?

328
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:23,491
We want to keep
this interview clean,

329
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:25,647
so it stands up in court.

330
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:42,139
- He's fucking with us.
- Maybe.

331
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:45,994
But his story seems to be just
on this side of plausible to me,

332
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:49,538
which means it'll seem plausible
to a jury and the D.A.

333
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,515
You don't know
the full fucking context.

334
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,459
And if there is
a full fucking context,

335
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:55,288
you might want to fill me in.

336
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,741
I can't.

337
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:01,024
I got to be sure this time.

338
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,975
- Teddy.
- Chief?

339
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,428
Bring Kurt Caldwell in.

340
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,608
- You got it, boss.
- Anything on the Molly Park APB?

341
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:09,905
Nothing yet,
but I forwarded

342
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,226
the line to my cell.

343
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:13,688
Okay.
Harrison.

344
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:17,257
Logan will bring you in
to see your father.

345
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,366
Just... five minutes, okay?

346
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,812
Thanks, Ange...
Chief Bishop.

347
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,913
Audrey, you come with me.

348
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:34,022
Harrison.

349
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:42,426
Oh.

350
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:44,171
Sorry. Protocol.

351
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:55,606
Just hang tight.

352
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,717
- I'll give you some privacy.
- Thank you.

353
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,585
What the hell?

354
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,961
Angela thinks
I killed Matt Caldwell.

355
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:24,176
This has nothing
to do with Kurt. You're safe.

356
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:28,679
Hey,
I've been in tougher spots.

357
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:30,342
I'll get out of this.

358
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,811
There's no way
I'm leaving you.

359
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,686
I promise.

360
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,854
- Night, Logan.
- Good night, Esther.

361
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:40,850
Angela's got this... theory,
but it'll never hold up.

362
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:43,070
We'll be on the road
in a day or two.

363
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,363
Well, what am I supposed
to do till then?

364
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:46,739
Go find Tess at The Tavern.

365
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:48,764
She'll feed you
and give you a room.

366
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:51,585
- Okay.
- Come on, guys.

367
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:56,928
We'll get through this.

368
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,599
The world needs us.

369
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:06,301
I'll be waiting for you.

370
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:08,089
And I'll find you.

371
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,882
Hey.

372
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:14,444
Stay tough.

373
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:21,147
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

374
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:28,678
You're a good man, Logan.

375
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:32,212
I hope you are, too,
for Harrison's sake.

376
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:36,856
I can't give you
all the details yet, but...

377
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,874
You know how Harrison told you
Jim wasn't his real name?

378
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:44,323
You said Harrison was high
and didn't mean it.

379
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,780
I didn't know it at the time,

380
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:50,374
but there's more to that story.

381
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,140
Like what?
What the hell is going on?

382
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:55,538
Honey,

383
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,655
I know this might be
hard to believe...

384
00:21:00,814 --> 00:21:02,356
...but Jim is dangerous.

385
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,835
Dangerous?

386
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:05,606
Then why were you dating him?

387
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:07,694
Why'd you let him
into our house?

388
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,180
Sometimes people
aren't who you think they are.

389
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,490
Wait, Audz.

390
00:21:22,793 --> 00:21:24,124
Go home.

391
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:26,616
Give Harrison some space.

392
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,176
Why?
Is he dangerous too?

393
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,788
No.

394
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,553
Look...

395
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,467
I promise I will tell you
everything tomorrow.

396
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:58,592
Turn around.
Hands through the slot.

397
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:01,882
All right.

398
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:08,671
This is nuts.

399
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:11,093
It's really putting me
in touch with my fear

400
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:13,678
of Harrison growing up
without a father.

401
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:15,764
I know you've been there.

402
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,891
Go to the far side of the cell.

403
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:25,761
Tuna.

404
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,526
Huh. Some things never change.

405
00:22:30,322 --> 00:22:32,866
I'm gonna go make sure
that Harrison is set up okay.

406
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:34,480
I'm not going anywhere.

407
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:37,335
And thank you.

408
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,717
Sons need their fathers.

409
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:05,007
Thanks for this.

410
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:08,671
Oh, you're doing me a favor.
Never fun eating alone.

411
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,573
I know this must be
really, really tough for you.

412
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,187
I'm not the one in jail.

413
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:18,160
I don't want to see Jim
go away, either.

414
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:21,329
Look, you got here around
the same time Matt disappeared.

415
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:23,497
Did you hear or-or see anything

416
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:25,417
that could help
exonerate your dad?

417
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:33,428
I-I wasn't in town yet, so I...

418
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:34,681
can't help.

419
00:23:34,773 --> 00:23:36,459
Are you gonna finish your fries?

420
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,205
I should head back
to the station.

421
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:50,358
- Later, Coach.
- Yeah.

422
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,428
Thanks for stopping by.

423
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:54,931
Oh, and, uh,

424
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:57,367
try not to eat hamburgers
three meals a day.

425
00:23:57,772 --> 00:24:00,035
I don't want you going up
too many weight classes

426
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,452
before wrestling starts
after New Year's.

427
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:29,898
Motherfucker.

428
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:55,155
Batista.

429
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,757
This is Chief Angela Bishop.

430
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:58,974
We met at that conference
in New York.

431
00:24:59,592 --> 00:25:01,139
Chief Bishop.

432
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:03,055
Uh...

433
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,828
I hope I didn't give you
the wrong impression.

434
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:06,218
You know,
I'm a happily married man.

435
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:07,858
This is a police matter.

436
00:25:07,952 --> 00:25:09,585
How can I help?

437
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:12,093
We've had some deaths
in Iron Lake

438
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,265
that are very similar
to an old Miami Metro case.

439
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,403
<i>Do you remember
the Bay Harbor Butcher?</i>

440
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,932
Cristo.
That was a gruesome one.

441
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:23,249
I looked at the autopsy photos
on the police database.

442
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:25,911
<i>- So, you've seen the, uh...</i>
- The dismemberments.

443
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:27,456
The whole thing.

444
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:31,725
What can you tell me
about Sergeant Doakes?

445
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,144
I sat next to him
every day for ten years.

446
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:36,264
Do you believe that he did it?

447
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:40,133
I did at the time, but there
were a few other theories.

448
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:42,436
My, uh, my ex-wife...

449
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:45,742
My old captain actually thought

450
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,433
it was someone else
in the precinct.

451
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:48,889
Who?

452
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:51,913
Dexter Morgan,
but he died years ago.

453
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,860
Chief Bishop?

454
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:00,561
Check your e-mail.

455
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:03,087
Okay. Hold on.

456
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:23,889
When was this taken?

457
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,770
Last month.

458
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,366
Madre de Dios.

459
00:26:32,646 --> 00:26:34,480
Dexter Morgan is alive?

460
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:37,194
And is sitting in my jail cell.

461
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:40,861
Can I have your
old captain's name?

462
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:42,322
I'd like to speak with her.

463
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:44,741
She was...

464
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,655
she was murdered.

465
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:53,061
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

466
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:57,264
<i>Did you ever catch the killer?</i>

467
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,275
Batista?

468
00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:14,827
Where are you?

469
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:16,891
I'll be there
first thing tomorrow

470
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:18,678
with everything I've got.

471
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:25,114
What's up, Teddy?

472
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:27,034
<i>Kurt Caldwell's
beat feet out of here.</i>

473
00:27:27,158 --> 00:27:29,827
<i>Front door unlocked,
safe empty, closets cleaned out.</i>

474
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:32,080
And guess what?
His gas truck's here.

475
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:34,873
<i>Emptied out.
Still smells like fresh gas.</i>

476
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:36,382
<i>Can you stay
at Kurt's overnight?</i>

477
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:37,898
<i>Just in case he shows up.</i>

478
00:27:37,983 --> 00:27:39,629
You got it, Chief.

479
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:49,608
Oh... geez.

480
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,487
Put that lying son of a bitch
back in my office.

481
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:06,319
You're not done for the night?

482
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:09,690
Oh, I'm just getting started.

483
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,052
You might actually get away with
the Matt Caldwell murder charge.

484
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:31,858
- Because I didn't do it.
- Oh, you did it, all right.

485
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:34,343
But I'm not entirely sure
my case will hold up enough

486
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:36,717
to convince the D.A.
and then the jury.

487
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:39,773
But hear this and know this.

488
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,546
I will stake my career,
my family,

489
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:45,421
my everything...

490
00:28:46,483 --> 00:28:47,822
that you're a murderer.

491
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:49,490
I'm worried about you.

492
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:51,577
I've got one word for you:

493
00:28:53,295 --> 00:28:54,588
Ketamine.

494
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:57,748
You picked up a healthy...
or unhealthy...

495
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,708
Amount from Dr. Patel.

496
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:02,067
Yeah, I needed it
for Vincent van Goat.

497
00:29:02,152 --> 00:29:03,600
You know he was sick.

498
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,062
Do you recognize this man?

499
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:11,387
Yeah, it's the piece of shit

500
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,555
who sold the drugs
that almost killed my son.

501
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:14,983
We...

502
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:18,180
ended up having
an unfortunate encounter.

503
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:20,022
About that encounter.

504
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:23,210
Miles O'Flynn
testified to me that,

505
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,780
"Just before he started pounding
on me, he poked me in the neck.

506
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:29,069
Like, with a needle
or something."

507
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,824
That was the exact same day
you picked up the ketamine

508
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,660
and several syringes
from Dr. Patel.

509
00:29:33,744 --> 00:29:35,257
You think I drugged him?

510
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,913
<i>I saw Logan question him
in this very station.</i>

511
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,242
There's no way he was drugged.

512
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:41,717
Only because Logan and Teddy

513
00:29:41,802 --> 00:29:43,510
showed up at Crystal Bar
before you could do it.

514
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:45,883
God, believe what you
want to believe.

515
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:49,677
You worked forensics in Miami.

516
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:51,678
You've seen
autopsy photos before.

517
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,231
Yes and yes.

518
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:01,421
Jasper Hodge.

519
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:06,651
Okay, I have no idea
where you're going with this.

520
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:09,939
It's called...

521
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:12,067
- A weal mark.
- ...a weal mark.

522
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,409
I heard he died

523
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:16,244
of an accidental
fentanyl overdose.

524
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,745
I can't say I'm sorry.

525
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:20,960
He also had ketamine
in his system.

526
00:30:21,507 --> 00:30:22,965
And only in his system.

527
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,927
None was found anywhere
in his house or his car.

528
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,146
- Well, I can't speak to that.
- Well...

529
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:30,038
...then speak to this.

530
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:40,999
Same weal marks.

531
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,733
Same drug showing up
in their tox report.

532
00:30:44,624 --> 00:30:46,733
It's what we call a pattern.

533
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:50,914
And it's how I know that you,
Dexter Morgan...

534
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:54,928
...are the Bay Harbor Butcher.

535
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:04,952
The Bay Harbor Butcher

536
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:08,741
was Miami Metro Detective
Sergeant James Doakes.

537
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,592
Not everyone believes that.

538
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:16,867
Tomorrow you'll be arraigned
for the murder of Matt Caldwell.

539
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:18,726
I'm gonna do my best
to see that it sticks

540
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:20,600
and you get life without parole.

541
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:22,780
And then,

542
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,198
win or lose,

543
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,632
you're gonna have
a little reunion

544
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,960
with your old friend
Angel Batista.

545
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,600
Yeah.

546
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:34,514
I met him at that Cop-Con thing.

547
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:37,811
He's on his way up from Miami
as we speak.

548
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:42,772
We're gonna extradite
your ass to Florida

549
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:45,585
where you'll stand trial
as the Bay Harbor Butcher.

550
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:50,905
Florida.

551
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:54,624
A state with the motherfucking
death penalty.

552
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,226
Turn off the camera.

553
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:08,272
Why the hell would I do that?

554
00:32:08,356 --> 00:32:10,067
I'll talk.

555
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:16,907
If you've got something to say,
just say it to the camera.

556
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:34,569
Listening.

557
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:37,194
What if I told you
you were right?

558
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:38,687
Well, then,
you'd be admitting to...

559
00:32:38,772 --> 00:32:40,220
I'm not admitting anything.

560
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:42,514
I'm saying you were right

561
00:32:42,692 --> 00:32:44,725
about Kurt Caldwell.

562
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,741
I can prove it.

563
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:50,105
Ange, you know in your heart

564
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:52,107
that Kurt killed Iris.

565
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:55,152
She was just his first.

566
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,710
He's been active for 25 years.

567
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:02,785
Very active.

568
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:04,718
What the hell are you
talking about?

569
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:06,132
Them.

570
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:10,530
Go to Kurt's cabin.

571
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:14,421
100 yards north
of the front door,

572
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:17,421
under a deadwood pile,
there's a hatch.

573
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:21,217
Open it, and you'll see
what real evil looks like.

574
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,968
I have dedicated
my entire life to this.

575
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:25,968
Yeah, and you've been met
with scorn and ridicule

576
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:28,914
at every turn because you've had
a gut feeling but no proof.

577
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,395
You go to that cabin,

578
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:32,342
and you'll finally have it.

579
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,194
Proof.

580
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,616
Fuck!

581
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:54,836
You turned off
the camera. What happened?

582
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:56,624
Put him back in his cell.
I've got to check something out.

583
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:59,241
- And that would be?
- Just fucking do it.

584
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:07,608
Harrison.

585
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,671
I-I came to get my stuff,

586
00:34:09,977 --> 00:34:13,189
since it doesn't look like
we're gonna move in together.

587
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:16,428
Come in.
Your stuff's upstairs.

588
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:20,678
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:23,899
I think this is all my fault.

590
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,850
How could this possibly
be your fault?

591
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:33,616
I told my Mom what you said
at the party.

592
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:35,127
If I had just kept
my mouth shut...

593
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,129
Th-This-this
isn't because of you.

594
00:34:37,213 --> 00:34:38,796
Then what's going on?

595
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:41,466
No one will tell me
what's happening.

596
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:43,845
I know.

597
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:48,222
I just...

598
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,600
Want this to be over.

599
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:53,546
For things to go back to normal.

600
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,405
Normal...

601
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:58,710
What's that?

602
00:34:59,788 --> 00:35:01,027
Things certainly weren't normal

603
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:03,092
when you and I were on track
to becoming brother and sister.

604
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:08,702
So, you think this arrest means
our parents are breaking up?

605
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,764
My dad told me
to wait at The Inn.

606
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,295
But it's really nice to see you.

607
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:21,819
Well, my mom said
to give you space.

608
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,887
But I guess we don't always have
to do what our parents want.

609
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:40,123
<i>Remember when you thought
not killing was the problem?</i>

610
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,340
<i>How's that going for you?</i>

611
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,568
I can figure this out.

612
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:49,147
<i>Angela's got her teeth in you.</i>

613
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:51,223
<i>She's never gonna let go.</i>

614
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,032
You did.

615
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:56,297
I was your sister.

616
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:58,967
I trusted you.

617
00:35:59,497 --> 00:36:01,404
I loved you.

618
00:36:01,715 --> 00:36:04,554
Angela's pretty fucking far
from that right now.

619
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,115
Enough!

620
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:11,814
Enough.

621
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:17,781
Hey, Logan,
can I get some water?

622
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:20,912
Kind of been doing
a lot of talking today.

623
00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:31,809
Yeah.

624
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,725
You talked Angela
right out of the station.

625
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,623
I'd give anything to know
what you said to her

626
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:38,000
when the camera was off.

627
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,000
I don't want to hurt you.

628
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:50,959
So, Angela was right about you.

629
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:53,787
She's a good cop and so are you,

630
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:56,537
but this is inevitable.

631
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:59,250
So, just give me the keys.

632
00:36:59,606 --> 00:37:01,483
Do it!

633
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:03,358
Don't be a hero, Logan.

634
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,601
I just need to get out
and see my son.

635
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:09,225
Good, good.
Good, good, good, good.

636
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:14,495
- Don't do that.
- Fuck you.

637
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:26,522
Damn it, Logan,
you should have listened to me.

638
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:07,575
Yo, Coach. Is my dad okay?

639
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:08,924
<i>It's me.</i>

640
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:11,381
Wh... Dad?

641
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:12,928
Where-where are you?

642
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:15,226
Come downstairs.
Meet me in front of the station.

643
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:17,944
Um, I'm at-I'm at Audrey's.

644
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,822
Okay, that's actually better.

645
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:21,242
Grab all your stuff.

646
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:23,210
My truck is in
Angela's driveway.

647
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:24,624
The key's in the cupholder.

648
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:26,692
<i>Meet me where we found
the white deer.</i>

649
00:38:26,776 --> 00:38:28,527
I got it.

650
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:31,929
Sun's coming up. Go.

651
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:33,992
Now.

652
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,960
Oh!

653
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:19,054
Annie Kurtz?

654
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,015
Jennifer Nùñez.

655
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:24,546
Oh, my... oh, my God.

656
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,559
Shannon Luu.

657
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:36,279
Lily Kosnicki.

658
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:46,288
Molly.

659
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,101
Logan. Logan, are you there?

660
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:17,237
Logan, do you copy? Pick up.

661
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,406
That was faster than I expected.

662
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,868
Logan. We have multiple bodies.

663
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,040
Oh, fuck.

664
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:44,056
Fuck!

665
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:52,416
'Sup, Chief?

666
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:54,607
Get me state troopers, CSI,

667
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:56,442
the coroners,
the motherfucking FBI.

668
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:58,111
I found something like 30 bodies

669
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:00,239
at the Caldwell property
on Stearn Road.

670
00:42:00,323 --> 00:42:01,948
I need all the backup I can get

671
00:42:02,032 --> 00:42:04,219
before this place turns into
a fucking media frenzy.

672
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:06,586
Holy shit. Got it. On it.

673
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:08,984
Wait, Teddy.

674
00:42:09,164 --> 00:42:11,710
Have you heard from Logan
in the past hour?

675
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:14,836
No. I think he's still
at the station with Jim.

676
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:19,257
Fuck! Fuck!

677
00:43:33,014 --> 00:43:34,557
Dad.

678
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:37,226
Grab your stuff
and leave the truck. Let's go.

679
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:39,484
Are you hurt?

680
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:41,404
No. I'm okay. Come on.

681
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:44,226
Whose blood is that?

682
00:43:46,195 --> 00:43:48,054
I'll explain everything later.
We need to go.

683
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:49,307
Now.

684
00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:56,479
Wait.

685
00:43:56,696 --> 00:43:58,765
You called me
from Logan's phone.

686
00:44:00,143 --> 00:44:02,310
Is that his blood?

687
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:06,619
There was no other way.

688
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:09,452
Is Coach dead?

689
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:14,623
Isn't the whole point

690
00:44:14,707 --> 00:44:16,952
that you only kill people
that deserve it?

691
00:44:17,209 --> 00:44:19,335
Coach Logan's a good person.

692
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:23,249
He wouldn't cooperate.

693
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:27,577
It's the only way I could
get back to you. Come on.

694
00:44:29,763 --> 00:44:32,098
Look, we'll talk
about everything,

695
00:44:32,182 --> 00:44:33,413
I promise,

696
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:36,209
but this is it.
We got to get out of here.

697
00:44:36,294 --> 00:44:37,670
Yeah.

698
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:39,523
Don't get caught.

699
00:44:40,229 --> 00:44:41,605
That's only a part of it.
Harrison...

700
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:43,070
Shut up.

701
00:44:43,243 --> 00:44:45,781
You don't really care
about saving anybody, do you?

702
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:48,741
You're just feeding
this-this Dark Passenger.

703
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:51,117
I-It's not even a passenger.

704
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:52,453
It's fucking driving.

705
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:54,036
And you like it.

706
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:56,476
You slashing Ethan

707
00:44:57,234 --> 00:44:58,925
and breaking
that wrestler's arm...

708
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,679
That's your own darkness.

709
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:03,163
You're just like me, buddy.

710
00:45:03,256 --> 00:45:04,839
No.

711
00:45:04,923 --> 00:45:06,991
I wanted to be like you...

712
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,648
so bad.

713
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:12,218
But m-my anger
isn't because I'm like you.

714
00:45:12,762 --> 00:45:15,843
My-my anger is because of you.

715
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,810
Of-of course I'm angry.

716
00:45:18,234 --> 00:45:21,273
You didn't just make
the decision to abandon me once.

717
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:23,594
You made that decision
every single day

718
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,226
you stayed away for ten years!

719
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,734
Well, I'm still your dad,
and I'm here now.

720
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,992
I'm right here.

721
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:44,129
Just come with me, buddy.

722
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:49,936
I can stop.

723
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:52,440
I can do it, with your help.

724
00:45:52,593 --> 00:45:54,460
I'm not your fucking caretaker.

725
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:56,382
I'm your goddamn son.

726
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:57,908
I want...

727
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:07,515
I need to be with you.

728
00:46:12,692 --> 00:46:14,902
You have to turn yourself in.

729
00:46:16,689 --> 00:46:18,400
There's no other way.

730
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:24,952
If I do,
I get the death penalty.

731
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:28,999
Maybe you deserve it.

732
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:42,711
Okay.

733
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,765
You don't have to come with me.

734
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:54,710
But I can't stay here.

735
00:47:06,684 --> 00:47:09,249
Would my mom still be alive
if it weren't for you?

736
00:47:09,803 --> 00:47:12,363
Would Aunt Deb still be alive?

737
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:15,971
And me...
would I be so fucked-up?

738
00:47:16,226 --> 00:47:19,296
Open your eyes
and look at what you've done!

739
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:35,687
You're right.

740
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:37,701
I don't...

741
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:40,054
I don't want to be right.

742
00:47:40,912 --> 00:47:42,390
I...

743
00:47:42,475 --> 00:47:44,804
I just... I want to be normal.

744
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:03,265
I'm sorry for everything
I've done to you.

745
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:09,952
You deserve better.

746
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:16,062
A better life.

747
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:21,249
A better father.

748
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,702
You have to take the safety off.

749
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:43,837
Just like I showed you.

750
00:48:56,982 --> 00:48:59,156
This is the only way out.

751
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:07,327
For both of us.

752
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:15,796
Now...

753
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,273
deep breath.

754
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,412
I've never really felt love.

755
00:49:33,983 --> 00:49:37,281
Real love.

756
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:39,366
Until now.

757
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:01,406
You did good.

758
00:50:50,186 --> 00:50:51,679
Drop the rifle! On your knees!

759
00:50:51,764 --> 00:50:54,348
Hands where I can see them!

760
00:50:54,564 --> 00:50:57,568
I'm... I stopped...
He-he killed Coach Logan.

761
00:50:57,653 --> 00:50:59,029
I know.

762
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:01,806
It's okay. You can get up.

763
00:51:22,151 --> 00:51:23,819
Okay.

764
00:51:24,977 --> 00:51:27,890
Take this.

765
00:51:28,468 --> 00:51:30,350
Go through town,
just past the Truck Stop

766
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:32,542
is the entrance to I-86 west.

767
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:35,906
Go, and never come back here.

768
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:39,648
Harrison.

769
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:42,671
You need to do this now.

770
00:51:49,622 --> 00:51:52,656
Uh, tell Audrey I said goodbye.

771
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:53,956
I can't.

772
00:51:54,149 --> 00:51:55,524
Why?

773
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:57,195
Because I haven't seen you.

774
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:45,718
This is Chief Bishop.

775
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,367
I'm calling to report
an officer-involved shooting.

776
00:52:52,353 --> 00:52:54,021

777

781
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,576
<i>I'd give anything to see
you and Harrison again.</i>

782
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:15,750

783
