ChatGPT:

A simple wrapper around Linear Regression to learn and predict the Celsius → Fahrenheit relationship

Requirements:
1. Let’s wrap everything into a clean Python class with clear comments and explanations in English.

2. One Class in a file named train_model.py for training the model
- What this does:
load_data() → loads your Celsius/Fahrenheit pairs.
train() → fits a linear regression model to the data.
print_model_parameters() → prints slope & intercept (should be close to 1.8 and 32).
predict() → predicts Fahrenheit for any Celsius input.
plot_results() → visualizes the data points and the regression line.

3. One Class in a file named save_model.py for saving the model in a folder named 'models' (placed in same folder as the script) having date and time in name
- By default, os.makedirs("models") will create the folder relative to wherever you run the script from. If you want it to always save in the models/ folder 
next to the script file (not depending on where you run python), you should anchor the path to the script’s directory with __file__.

4. One Class in a file named evaluate_model.py for evaluating the model
- We’ll create another file (evaluator.py) with a class ModelEvaluator. This class will:
Load any saved model from the models/ folder.
Evaluate it on the original Celsius → Fahrenheit dataset (or any test dataset you provide).
Report metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score (common for regression tasks).

5. A main.py file who will run the train_model.py and save_model.py files
