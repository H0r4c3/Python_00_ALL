'''
Once you have found one or two algorithms that perform well on your dataset, you may want to improve the performance of those models.
One way to increase the performance of an algorithm is to tune its parameters to your specific dataset.
The scikit-learn library provides two ways to search for combinations of parameters for a machine learning algorithm. Your goal in todayâ€™s lesson is to practice each.
Tune the parameters of an algorithm using a grid search that you specify.
Tune the parameters of an algorithm using a random search.
The snippet below uses is an example of using a grid search for the Ridge Regression algorithm on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset.
