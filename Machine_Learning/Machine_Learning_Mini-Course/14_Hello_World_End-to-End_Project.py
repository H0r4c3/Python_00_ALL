# Lesson 14: Hello World End-to-End Project

'''
You now know how to complete each task of a predictive modeling machine learning problem.
In todayâ€™s lesson, you need to practice putting the pieces together and working through a standard machine learning dataset end-to-end.
Work through the iris dataset end-to-end (the hello world of machine learning)
This includes the steps:
Understanding your data using descriptive statistics and visualization.
Preprocessing the data to best expose the structure of the problem.
Spot-checking a number of algorithms using your own test harness.
Improving results using algorithm parameter tuning.
Improving results using ensemble methods.
Finalize the model ready for future use.
