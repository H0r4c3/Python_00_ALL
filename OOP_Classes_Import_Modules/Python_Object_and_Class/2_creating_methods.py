# instantiate the object
blu = Parrot("Blu", 10)

# call our instance methods
print(blu.sing("'Happy'"))
print(blu.dance())
print(blu.name)


'''
In the above program, we define two methods i.e sing() and dance(). These are called instance methods because they are called on an instance object i.e blu.
