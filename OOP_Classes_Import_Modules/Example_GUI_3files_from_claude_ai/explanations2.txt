Let me walk you through the mechanism of passing values from the GUI input fields to the data processing class, breaking down the process step by step.
The key to this value transfer is the callback mechanism implemented in the main.py file. Let's dive into the details:

Callback Function Setup
In the Application class's __init__ method, we create the connection:

pythonCopyself.gui = DataEntryGUI(self.process_input)
This line passes the process_input method as a callback function to the GUI. It means when the GUI wants to submit data, it will call this specific method.

GUI Submission Process
In the data_gui.py file, when the "Submit" button is clicked, the submit_data() method is called:

pythonCopydef submit_data(self):
    val1 = self.entry1.get()
    val2 = self.entry2.get()
    val3 = self.entry3.get()

    if val1 and val2 and val3:
        self.submit_callback(val1, val2, val3)
Here's what happens:

self.entry1.get() retrieves the text from the first input field
Similarly for entry2 and entry3
If all fields are filled, it calls self.submit_callback()
The submit_callback is the process_input method we passed earlier


Processing the Values
In main.py, the process_input method receives these values:

pythonCopydef process_input(self, val1, val2, val3):
    # Use DataProcessor to process and store values
    self.data_processor.process_values(val1, val2, val3)
    
    # Print the processed values
    self.data_processor.print_values()
This method does two things:

Calls process_values() on the DataProcessor instance to store the values
Calls print_values() to display the stored values

Let me illustrate this with an analogy:

Think of the GUI as a postal service
The callback function is like a specific address
When you fill out a form (input fields) and submit it, the postal service (GUI) delivers the data to that specific address (callback method)
The address (callback method) then hands the letter (input values) to the recipient (DataProcessor)

Key Benefits of this Approach:

Decoupling: The GUI doesn't need to know how the data will be processed
Flexibility: You can change the processing logic without modifying the GUI
Reusability: The same GUI can be used with different processing methods

Mental Exercise:
Try to imagine how you might modify this to:

Validate the input before processing
Send the data to a different type of processor
Store the data in a database instead of printing

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or demonstrate how you might extend this functionality?
