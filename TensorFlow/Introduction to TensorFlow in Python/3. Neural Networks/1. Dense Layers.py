'''
The input layer contains 3 features -- education, marital status, and age -- which are available as borrower_features. 
The hidden layer contains 2 nodes and the output layer contains a single node.

For each layer, you will take the previous layer as an input, initialize a set of weights, compute the product of the inputs and weights, and then apply 
an activation function. 
Note that Variable(), ones(), matmul(), and keras() have been imported from tensorflow.

# Using keras
'''
To construct this network, we'll need to define three dense layers, each of which takes the previous layer as an input, 
multiplies it by weights, and applies an activation function. Note that input data has been defined and is available as a 100x10 tensor: borrower_features. 
Additionally, the keras.layers module is available.

# Define the first dense layer
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(7, activation='sigmoid')(borrower_features)

# Define a dense layer with 3 output nodes
dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='sigmoid')(dense1)

# Define a dense layer with 1 output node
predictions = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense2)

# Print the shapes of dense1, dense2, and predictions
print('\n shape of dense1: ', dense1.shape)
print('\n shape of dense2: ', dense2.shape)
print('\n shape of predictions: ', predictions.shape)


# Initialize x_1 and x_2
x_1 = Variable(6.0,float32)
x_2 = Variable(0.3,float32)

# Define the optimization operation
opt = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

for j in range(100):
	# Perform minimization using the loss function and x_1
	opt.minimize(lambda: loss_function(x_1), var_list=[x_1])
	# Perform minimization using the loss function and x_2
	opt.minimize(lambda: loss_function(x_2), var_list=[x_2])

# Print x_1 and x_2 as numpy arrays
print(x_1.numpy(), x_2.numpy())



# Initialize x_1 and x_2
x_1 = Variable(0.05,float32)
